"I've used [REDACTED] previously several times for tyre purchase and fitting for three of my cars and each time the service has worked seamlessly and very efficiently. On a previous occasion, I needed to contact their CS dept. and was rapidly and properly served by a helpful, professional and friendly UK agent. Lots of companies could potentially sell tyres only online but [REDACTED].com also have the UK national fitting service options fully covered. So each time, as now, I purchased tyres from [REDACTED].com and ordered a fitting service from ATS Euromaster at our branch in Knutsford (incidentally those friendly guys there, Mark & Andy, are always excellent and bang on time). The fact that [REDACTED].com deliver exactly the tyre you order online to your chosen fitting depot and it's always there for when you arrive for the fitting is great. In short, it all works without any fuss or issue. Plus importantly, the [REDACTED] prices have always been the most competitive (online or offline); with or without the fitting element.

Questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience. Firstly the purchasing experience was not great. I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.,garage service negative,location positive,"['questionable', 'buying', 'process', 'terrible', 'fitting', 'experience', 'firstly', 'purchasing', 'experience', 'great', 'entered', 'registration', 'shown', 'tyre', 'supposedly', 'suitable', 'car', 'looking', 'bridgestone', 's001', 'run', 'flat', 'tyre', 's001', 'tyre', 'appeared', 'top', 'search', 'result', 'seemed', 'good', 'price', 'ordered', 'instantly', 'got', 'email', 'redacted', 'saying', 'think', 'ordered', 'wrong', 'tyre', 'one', 'ordered', 'non', 'run', 'flat', 'car', 'would', 'run', 'flat', 'looking', 'website', 'correct', 'tyre', '4', 'page', 'search', 'result', 'total', '65', 'expensive', 'clearly', 'system', 'knew', 'time', 'checkout', 'potentially', 'wrong', 'tyre', 'got', 'automated', 'email', 'placed', 'order', 'trapped', 'ask', 'time', 'checkout', 'pay', 'extra', 'money', 'took', 'total', 'price', 'quote', 'receivedthen', 'onto', 'fitting', 'garage', 'min', 'house', 'booked', '8am', 'saturday', 'arrived', '750am', 'took', '1', 'hour', '45', 'min', 'fit', '2', 'tyre', 'impressed', 'drove', 'away', 'long', 'wait', 'car', 'warned', 'pressure', 'driver', 'rear', 'tyre', 'low', '10', 'psi', 'le', 'rest', 'either', 'garage', 'put', 'enough', 'tyre', 'leaking', 'air', 'went', 'back', 'garage', 'get', 'checked', 'leak', 'enough', 'air', 'put', 'dangerous', 'drove', 'away', 'second', 'time', 'see', 'time', 'tyre', 'still', 'enough', 'air', 'match', 'rest', 'tyre', 'ended', 'going', 'petrol', 'garage', 'fixing', 'issue', 'air', 'pump', 'small', 'point', 'also', 'alloy', 'tyre', 'absolutely', 'covered', 'white', 'tyre', 'lub', 'expect', 'alloy', 'smothered', 'take', 'car', 'cleaner', 'alsoso', 'summary', 'questionable', 'buying', 'process', 'terrible', 'fitting', 'experience']","{'incorrect tyres sent': 'negative', 'garage service': 'negative', 'wait time': 'negative'}",negative

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy's fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.",damage negative,garage service negative,"['redacted', 'ok', 'mcconechys', 'ok', 'ordered', 'new', 'tyre', 'redacted', 'online', 'good', 'price', 'good', 'prompt', 'service', 'redacted', 'however', 'made', 'massive', 'mistake', 'choosing', 'mcconechys', 'sighthill', 'edinburgh', 'nominated', 'tyre', 'fitter', 'clear', 'redacted', 'customer', 'actual', 'mcconechys', 'customer', 'appearing', 'workplace', 'wanting', 'tyre', 'fitted', 'actual', 'fact', 'annoyance', 'getting', 'waymcconechys', 'fitted', 'tyre', 'although', 'im', 'sure', 'reluctantlyupon', 'told', 'tyre', 'fitter', 'car', 'ready', 'go', 'walked', 'car', 'noticed', 'dustcaps', 'fitted', 'request', '2', 'new', 'dustcaps', 'fitted', 'left', 'handed', 'tyre', 'fitting', 'paperworka', 'day', 'later', 'checking', 'air', 'pressure', 'new', 'tyre', 'also', 'noticed', 'mcconechys', 'even', 'changed', 'valve', 'stem', 'either', 'contacted', 'mcconechys', 'tyre', 'fitter', 'done', 'work', 'answered', 'phone', 'told', 'noticed', 'changed', 'valve', 'stem', 'got', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'existing', 'valve', 'stem', 'metal', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'wanted', 'rubber', 'valve', 'stem', 'fitted', 'bother', 'change', 'afterthought', 'stated', 'changed', 'valve', 'core', 'thoughi', 'dont', 'believe', 'word', 'tyre', 'fitter', 'guy', 'doesnt', 'know', 'im', 'fully', 'qualified', 'engineer', 'know', 'corner', 'cutting', 'see', 'remember', 'actually', 'request', 'fit', 'dustcaps', 'unfortunately', 'didnt', 'notice', 'mcconechys', 'changed', 'valve', 'stem', 'time', 'would', 'pulled', 'right', 'theni', 'know', 'didnt', 'change', 'valve', 'stem', 'rusted', 'badly', 'corroded', 'might', 'take', 'bit', 'longer', 'remove', 'change', 'maybe', 'even', 'problem', 'thats', 'changed', 'b', 'story', 'metali', 'paid', '2', 'new', 'tyre', 'fitted', 'balanced', 'new', 'valve', 'stem', 'new', 'valve', 'fitted', 'goti', 'got', '2', 'new', 'tyre', 'fitted', 'balanced', 'without', 'new', 'valve', 'stem', 'story', 'dont', 'believe', 'valve', 'core', 'changedbut', 'make', 'ok', 'doesnt', 'certainly', 'doesnt', 'also', 'supposed', 'free', 'wheel', 'alignment', 'check', 'done', 'mcconechys', 'fitter', 'never', 'made', 'mention', 'already', 'decided', 'go', 'ahead', 'alignment', 'check', 'anywayalso', 'state', 'tyre', 'fitting', 'paperwork', 'wheel', 'nut', 'torqued', '110nm', 'well', 'checked', '50', 'mile', 'later', 'wheel', 'nut', 'different', 'torque', 'level', 'locking', 'wheel', 'nut', 'tightest', 'fari', 'believe', '1', 'second', 'wheel', 'even', 'torqued', 'first', 'place', 'like', 'slammed', 'back', 'racked', 'air', 'gun', 'way', 'wheel', 'nut', 'seen', 'torque', 'wrench', 'mcconechys', 'tyre', 'fitter', 'wasis', 'story', 'telling', 'corner', 'cutter', 'avoid', 'mcconechys', 'customer', 'annoyance', 'getting', 'way', 'happy', 'thissteven', 'dryden']",{'garage service': 'positive'},positive

I was thinking of removing the run flat tyres from our F31 330d for many reasons but this was a job for the future...... until on my way home from work 2 days before we went on Holiday to France I picked up a puncture.

[REDACTED] were amazing, they were quick and professional even to the point where they had realised that I had ordered non runflat tyres and sent me a warning Email in case I was not aware of my error. The tyres were delivered the next day to the garage of my choice in Lincoln. F1 Autocentres even managed to get the car in a day early so as we could be on our way to Holiday on time.

This seems like rather poor planning on [REDACTED]' part.

Secondly, the available locations were confusing, as there were multiple locations for the same business (Charles Hurst).

Only the tyre that I had ordered (which turned up at the second location without any mention of a booking) led to the staff at the second location being aware of the booking, and so they were able to carry out the tyre change.

Tuesday evening came an email at 17.31 saying there had been a delay on the tyre and they needed to reschedule to Friday. This was no good to us as we needed it fitting Thursday at the latest due to a long drive. The option to call them straight away wasn't there, as their offices close at 17.30 coincidentally! Called them first thing Wednesday AM, my partner stressed that a fitting for Friday was not possible and Thursday would be the latest we could have it done.After speaking to the woman on the phone for 10 minutes and a few back and forth phone calls later, she agreed to have a fitter come out and fit the tyre on Thursday (AM) email confirmation received stating AM delivey/fitting.Thursday 11:30am and the fitter still hadn't arrived.

"Great prices appalling organisational skills Would not use again. I needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my MOT and I had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster. A friend suggested I check out [REDACTED], the prices looked great and a good range of local garages (5 within 6 miles or so of me) so I went ahead and placed an order. The following day (Friday) I received an email from them saying they couldn't book me in on the Saturday at my chosen garage and the next available slot was the following Monday. I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded. No apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone I had never spoken with.

"I have used you in the past and had excellent service, the past company I had the tyres fitted at were excellent, but no longer one of your options for fitting now. I chose your premium fitter in Basingstoke, Formula One Auto - and they were awful. Their customer service was non existent. I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people.

Queried with [REDACTED] why there was no time on the confirmation email and was told it was a first come first served basis. On arriving at the fitting centre they had no record of this new booking and said that they didn't have a tyre fitter in that day so couldn't fit my tyres. Rebooked directly with them for Monday 12th at 9am. Turned up promptly and it still took an hour and 15mins for my tyres to be done. Email thread below. Your request has been updated. To add additional comments, reply to this email. Vishnu, Aug 1, 09:53 BST: Dear Martin, Thank you for your email. The garage works on first come first serve basis so you can visit the garage anytime between 09:00 - 11:30 for AM appointment. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Martin, Further to our previous correspondence, I can confirm your tyres have arrived for your fitting today. The garage has scheduled a fitting for you on 06/08/2019 (Tuesday) at for AM appointment, please let me know if this is not suitable and we can look into alternatives to fit in with your schedule. Once again I am very sorry for the delays that have been caused on this order. We will be looking into how such delays can be avoided again in the future and prevent inconvenience to our customers. Thanks, Vasim Terence, Jul 30, 17:41 BST: Dear. Martin, I am sorry to advise that we have encountered a delay in delivering your tyres in time for your requested fitting tomorrow. Due to the delay we are no longer able to honor your scheduled appointment time, at this stage we would now be looking to reschedule your appointment from 02/08/2019 (Friday) onward to allow us time to rectify the delay and ensure your tyres are at the garage. Could you please advise a suitable time and date from 02/08/2019 (Friday) onward that I would be able to re-schedule your appointment to and I will action this with your chosen garage and send over an updated conformation email. You can either reply to this email or you can call us on 01721 540650. We are open until 5:30pm on weekdays, I appreciate that this is short notice however we have only just been made aware that the tyres have not been delivered and understand this is frustrating. Once again, I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused, please be assured that we will continue to work to resolve this as quickly as possible for you.

Rear driver side tyre low as tyre was leaking air. Also noticed the tyre fitters had damaged wheels. Had to drive to the fitters to sort out air leak and complained about fresh damage to wheels. Took abou half for them to sort wheels and decided I would complain in writing rather than confront the fitters as at the time I was and am fuming. - 15/08. MOT booked in with BMW. Car passed MOT. However I was advised that the front brake pad warning wire was hanging. Had to book car in again on the 18/08 to be rectified.19/08. BMW checked the front brake pad warning wire. Brake Pads and discs replaced by BMW in March and was advised by BMW that the front brake pad warning compartment was cracked and the wire left hanging when the tyres were changed.Im not one to complain.

"A bit of a mixed bag of goodbadgreat. A bit of a mixed bag in terms of overall experience I'm afraid, so lower rating than I anticipated. Finding and paying for the tires online, including the actual price for high grade Michelins, was all very good...things just fell apart after choosing the deliver and fit option to a local (big name) garage. Using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs I had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked. Then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times I offered (a week later than my original slot mind you!). The worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers?! Bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed [REDACTED] for offering something online that well basically, wasn't offered in the real world. I have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when I returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably, so the eventual service was great.

No notice of being unable to fit tyres offered fitting five days later. Ordered a Tyre for my daughters car as existing tyre irreparable. As no spare until replaced could not drive car. Ordered on Weds for fitting Saturday morning. Received an e mail at 7.51 am about feedback and another at 7.52 stating that the tyre could not be fitted on Saturday and the earliest date for fitting would be five days later on Weds. During this time my daughter would have no driveable car. She needed the car on Saturday. This meant I had little chance of finding a local tyre fitter to fit a tyre on the busiest morning of the week and certainly not at a competitive price. Very poor service to be told just before fitting time the order could not be fulfilled.

Better if [REDACTED] mentions Tyre Thread Depth.

Asked if they can do the following Saturday to which they said we only have time on Monday. Ended up just calling the garage like you either have the tyre or not?

Friday comes and I get to the fitter who tells me that they have only had 3 tyres delivered of the 4 I ordered and paid for. I ended up having the three fitted and left the best one of the previous 4 on. I phoned them whilst I was at the fitter. They apologised again and said that they will refund the 4th tyre, Give me £20 off and also a 10% voucher for when next I use them.

"Trouble free from choosing to fitting. This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive. Supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything. You can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide.You can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch. The app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage.If the garage offers other services you can order these aswell, but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there.The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms.The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know who can benefit from the service.Prices are competitive and I found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.If you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address.If you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to. They simply issue a full refund. No pressure at all. Easy.My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent.

I got a call at 11.47 from the tyre fitters asking me for my pin so that could start the electric engine in my car to move it. It had not been moved from where I parked it At 12.30 I decided to go back down to the tyre fitters they were still in the process of fitting my tyres. My car was blocked by another car that had no wheels on it. I the had to wait for these wheels to be fitted. I finally got away about 1.30pm. I had asked for the best of the 2 tyres to be put into my boot. so that I could keep it for emergency puncture replacement. I got home it was not there.

"Garage Was Great [REDACTED] Wasnt. Overall, I'm really chuffed with the product (4 x Michelin Pilot Sport 4's) and the job the premier partner (Strathclyde Autotune) carried out.However, the customer service experience at [REDACTED] left a lot to be desired after it came to light I was consistently given incorrect information by email, and later on the phone.To cut a long story short, [REDACTED] appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day.I booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services.I was never given an appointment time. Similarly, the services I selected were split across a Friday and a Monday.Not the end of the world..but the tyre fitting was scheduled for Friday and TPMS Sensor Valve Replacement was scheduled for the Monday.For me it made more sense to fit the sensors on Friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres?Anyway, I phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why I wasn't given an appointment time.I was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services I asked for.I struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but I went along with it as I had already paid for the tyres.Cut To: Me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue.After arriving at the garage before the staff, I thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first?Turns out that the garage has an appointment book, and [REDACTED] tell you it's first-come-first-serve, and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience?The garage was great though!..

"The company that only puts itself first never the customer.

I had to shout at the unresponsive engineer to lower my car immediately upon noticing (only by chance) their incompetence. The fitter then proved argumentative, dishonest before shouting their refusal to do any further work at all -despite the fact the work was already paid for via [REDACTED]. I have made yet another complaint to [REDACTED] for this further diabolical low level of quality product and customer service offered via their company -who have again sought to ignore this complaint as well.

"Do not use Very poor customer service. Yes, the tyres they sell are at a more competitive price than the manufacturer of my car however their customer service is appalling. I spent almost £300 on new tyres and booked a fitting slot for the Wednesday the following week only to receive an email literally 24hrs in advance saying there was a delay on my order. There was no explanation for the delay and they rebooked me a new slot without even phoning me to discuss a suitable day. As a result I had to take a day off work to accommodate this as I couldn’t postpone the fitting any longer.

"Excellent prices and service.I have used [REDACTED] several times over recent years. I require quality high performance tyres and they have ALWAYS been the lowest price compared to all other suppliers online. On the most recent purchase I had an issue ( not BC’s fault, but my own error ) and they contacted me as I requested and they resolved the issue I had straight away - how customer service should be. I have also never had any problems when I have attended one of their many fitting partners - also have the option for the fitters to come to the customer for a reasonable £6 extra charge - I’ve never used that option so can’t comment on its quality. Out of curiosity I asked the recent fitting centre I had used how much the tyre supply and fitmeant would cost if I bought the tyre from them. I was surprised to hear that their fully fitted price for the exact same tyre would have been £75 more !

It therefore came as a shock to experience really poor service on this occassion.Everything seemed fine at first, my order went though and I was looking forward to having two reasonably priced tyres fitted at a convenient time on a Saturday morning. Later that day I received an email to say the garage could not fit my tyres on the Saturday, that was slightly annoying but OK, I replied to the email to say their suggested fitting day of the following Tuesday would be fine.The next day I receive an email saying they can't deliver my tyres to the garage for the following Tuesday, bearing in mind that it's only Friday at this point and if so why was it even suggested to me as a possible fitting date. Their new suggested day wasn't convenient and I was beginning to feel messed around so I replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that I'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order. Three days later and I still had not received a response or order cancellation from them. I sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order. It was another day, nearly a wek after the initial order that it was finally cancelled. There was no apology, no explanation, nothing in their email.I really am confused as to why [REDACTED] would think I should use them again or reccommend them to friends or family.

"2 new tyres and a lot of waiting around. The purchase and arrangement of 2 new tyres for fitting at a convenient local garage was good. The price was a noticeable saving, and the pre-arranged fitting time meant I was expected at the garage reception. So far so good, with full marks to [REDACTED] at this point. My question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres ? Ok, they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started, and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment. But the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1.25hrs, and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit. For 2 tyres. On a prearranged 1/2 hr slot. With 5 days notice. This to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to, and I wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day.If Red Bull's F1 team can do it in 1.88 seconds with half a lap's notice , how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this ?

Price was good and choice of fitting locations is helpful. Generally satisfied with [REDACTED].Just 2 issues:- Once a fitting service is selected you are given a calendar to select the day and time. Having selected an early morning time for my convenience at the designated supplier i was contacted later and told the time selected wasnt available. That was less convenient.The supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream BMW garage and not a specialist tyre fitter. They were clearly more focused on their BMW customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel. This was apologetically rectified but resulted in the fitting of one tyre taking 2 hours. Instead of being fitted and on my way by 9-00 am as originally planned it was gone 12-00 when the job was completed.,value for money positive,location positive,"['price', 'good', 'choice', 'fitting', 'location', 'helpful', 'generally', 'satisfied', 'redactedjust', '2', 'issue', 'fitting', 'service', 'selected', 'given', 'calendar', 'select', 'day', 'time', 'selected', 'early', 'morning', 'time', 'convenience', 'designated', 'supplier', 'contacted', 'later', 'told', 'time', 'selected', 'wasnt', 'available', 'le', 'convenientthe', 'supplier', 'selected', 'nearest', 'convenient', 'mainstream', 'bmw', 'garage', 'specialist', 'tyre', 'fitter', 'clearly', 'focused', 'bmw', 'customer', 'despite', 'clear', 'instruction', 'fitted', 'replacement', 'tyre', 'wrong', 'wheel', 'apologetically', 'rectified', 'resulted', 'fitting', 'one', 'tyre', 'taking', '2', 'hour', 'instead', 'fitted', 'way', '900', 'originally', 'planned', 'gone', '1200', 'job', 'completed']",{'garage service': 'positive'},positive

"Unfortunately, you can't beat their prices, but I've had some mixed experiences, and I'm struggling to trust the honesty / integrity of the company as a whole.1) I booked a fitted service for my wife's car, and was given a timed appointment, which was really inconvenient (no choice of times), so I called customer service to see if it could be changed ""let me check with the garage"" said the lady on the phone, followed by ""the garage has no other availability on that day"", etc, etc. So I called the garage directly and explained that I'd like to come earlier if possible and got ""no problem sir, come along for when we open, and we'll get you straight in""... did customer service actually speak with the garage, given how accommodating they were when I called, I doubt it!2) Different garage, and 4 tyres for my car... I had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres, and a very muddled experience from start to finish... they didn't have my paperwork, couldn't find my tyres, were questioning whether I was there on the right day, etc. and then the length of time to actually change the tyres, whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing. I took the time to write a detailed review of the garage on the [REDACTED] website, but that review hasn't been published weeks on, and the garage still has a 5 star rating, leading me to believe that [REDACTED] are trying to protect the reputation of their premier partner garages despite customer experiences.",length of fitting negative,ease of booking negative,"['unfortunately', 'cant', 'beat', 'price', 'ive', 'mixed', 'experience', 'im', 'struggling', 'trust', 'honesty', 'integrity', 'company', 'whole1', 'booked', 'fitted', 'service', 'wife', 'car', 'given', 'timed', 'appointment', 'really', 'inconvenient', 'choice', 'time', 'called', 'customer', 'service', 'see', 'could', 'changed', 'let', 'check', 'garage', 'said', 'lady', 'phone', 'followed', 'garage', 'availability', 'day', 'etc', 'etc', 'called', 'garage', 'directly', 'explained', 'id', 'like', 'come', 'earlier', 'possible', 'got', 'problem', 'sir', 'come', 'along', 'open', 'well', 'get', 'straight', 'customer', 'service', 'actually', 'speak', 'garage', 'given', 'accommodating', 'called', 'doubt', 'it2', 'different', 'garage', '4', 'tyre', 'car', 'poor', 'experience', 'apparently', 'took', 'garage', '2', 'hour', '10', 'minute', 'change', '4', 'tyre', 'muddled', 'experience', 'start', 'finish', 'didnt', 'paperwork', 'couldnt', 'find', 'tyre', 'questioning', 'whether', 'right', 'day', 'etc', 'length', 'time', 'actually', 'change', 'tyre', 'whilst', 'mechanic', 'floated', 'aimlessly', 'around', 'garage', 'nothing', 'took', 'time', 'write', 'detailed', 'review', 'garage', 'redacted', 'website', 'review', 'hasnt', 'published', 'week', 'garage', 'still', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'leading', 'believe', 'redacted', 'trying', 'protect', 'reputation', 'premier', 'partner', 'garage', 'despite', 'customer', 'experience']",{'garage service': 'negative'},negative

"I ordered a Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 255/45 R17 W (98) tyre for my Mercedes on the [REDACTED] website. As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.",booking confusion negative,ease of booking negative,"['ordered', 'dunlop', 'sp', 'sport', 'maxx', '25545', 'r17', 'w', '98', 'tyre', 'mercedes', 'redacted', 'website', 'usual', 'took', 'screenshot', 'order', 'confirmation', 'screen', 'showing', 'detail', 'record', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'received', 'email', 'confirmation', 'redacted', 'indicated', 'ordered', 'bmw', 'runflat', 'version', 'dunlop', 'sp', 'sport', 'maxx', 'rang', 'query', 'although', 'sale', 'person', 'pleasant', 'seemed', 'unable', 'accept', 'ordered', 'bmw', 'runflat', 'version', 'even', 'emailed', 'copy', 'screenshot', 'cancelled', 'order', 'still', 'insisted', 'ordering', 'screen', 'system', 'quite', 'clear', 'must', 'accidentally', 'ordered', 'wrong', 'tyre', 'subtext', 'another', 'stupid', 'customeri', 'since', 'rerun', 'attempt', 'order', 'tyre', 'suggest', 'redacted', 'may', 'benefit', 'redesigning', 'ordering', 'screen', 'debugging', 'order', 'confirmation', 'screen', 'enter', 'tyre', 'number', 'vehicle', 'tyre', 'orderscreen', 'offer', 'number', 'box', 'row', 'three', 'feature', 'various', 'brand', 'tyre', 'size', 'large', 'headline', 'text', 'box', 'brand', 'price', 'classified', 'name', 'tyre', 'case', 'dunlop', 'sp', 'sport', 'maxx', 'gt', 'followed', 'generic', 'therefore', 'worthless', '4', '5star', 'review', '5star', 'review', 'price', 'narrow', 'ruledoff', 'area', 'one', 'unexplained', 'icon', 'logo', 'offered', 'brand', 'seem', 'tiny', 'black', 'car', 'icon', 'presumably', 'indicate', 'totally', 'confused', 'among', 'u', 'tyre', 'car', 'rather', 'bicycle', 'airplane', 'tyre', 'various', 'car', 'logo', 'bmw', 'mercedes', 'ferrari', 'etc', 'well', 'run', 'flat', 'mo', 'explanation', 'whether', 'something', 'special', 'dunlop', 'sp', 'sport', 'maxx', 'gt', 'tyre', 'bmw', 'logo', 'make', 'suitable', 'bmw', 'anyway', 'offer', 'response', 'inquiry', 'mercedes', 'tyre', 'one', 'compulsory', 'field', 'ordering', 'screen', 'symbol', 'critical', 'correct', 'ordering', 'tyre', 'specific', 'particular', 'vehicle', 'wouldnt', 'sensible', 'much', 'larger', 'relevance', 'explainedthen', 'allowed', 'customer', 'order', 'tyre', 'specific', 'particular', 'vehicle', 'doesnt', 'order', 'confirmation', 'screen', 'include', 'fact', 'hadnt', 'checked', 'confirmation', 'email', 'carefully', 'could', 'easily', 'ended', 'wrong', 'tyre', 'carso', 'redacted', 'want', 'try', 'need', 'let', 'know', 'either', 'amended', 'issue', 'explained', 'dont', 'need']",{'incorrect tyres sent': 'negative'},negative

"Ordering the tyres online and getting them delivered was absolutely fine and they would get 5 stars for this. However the issues I had with the garage (F1 Autocentres - Gloucester) after is the reason this gets a low star rating.I was originally booked in for a Saturday. I turn up, after getting a reminder of my booking via text I might add. The garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres. They were sick. So I was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before I left. But I don't blame them for people calling in sick. I was asked to come back on Sunday.So I turn up on Sunday @ 11am and since I didn't need the car I was happy to leave it there all day. Was told to come back at 4pm. I come back and they have not even started my car. I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking I had requested with it. The only positive, and why I gave 2 stars and not 1. Is they offered to do the tracking for free.Had to go back on Tuesday. I turn up on time as requested, but they are not ready, ask me to come back in 45 minutes. So I do that, have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen. At the end they only did the front tracking. So I had to go back again on Wednesday. This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving.But overall the service was not good. Having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking. I will not be using that garage again.

"This was my first time trying [REDACTED].com. I was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the Thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the Friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock. I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future.",value for money positive,location positive,"['first', 'time', 'trying', 'redactedcom', 'desperate', 'get', 'tyre', 'next', 'day', 'picking', 'puncture', 'thursday', 'weekend', 'trip', 'leaving', 'friday', 'night', 'amazing', 'hard', 'get', 'decent', 'sport', 'tyre', 'next', 'day', 'noone', 'carry', 'stock', 'id', 'first', 'tried', 'making', 'booking', 'kwik', 'fit', 'mobile', 'fitting', 'rejected', 'halfway', 'booking', 'process', 'charged', 'took', 'week', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'place', 'could', 'find', 'redactedcom', 'offering', 'good', 'sport', 'tyre', 'next', 'day', 'reasonable', 'price', 'fitted', 'local', 'hiq', 'garage', 'seemed', 'good', 'true', 'hiq', 'charged', 'money', 'couldnt', 'till', 'next', 'tuesday', 'yet', 'redacted', 'could', 'get', 'tyre', 'next', 'day', 'cheaper', 'price', 'review', 'looked', 'good', 'took', 'chance', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'appointment', 'first', 'thing', 'next', 'morning', 'tyre', 'arrived', 'problem', '10am', 'job', 'done', 'seem', 'good', 'service', 'put', 'major', 'tyre', 'shop', 'like', 'national', 'shame', 'get', 'tyre', 'centre', '23', 'day', 'plus', 'price', 'good', 'certainly', 'look', 'redactedcom', 'future']",{'garage service': 'positive'},positive

"Kind of feel strange leaving this review since I purchased from them based on the Truspilot's generally great feedback for this company...The appointment cancelled by a text. Alright, I thought.. this happens... The cancellation text followed by a polite email from one of their representatives... - 'We are working on it' etc.... Good, they are taking care of it... Unfortunately, no follow up the next day. An email sent to them.. and another one. Still no reply... - Right, looks like I will need to ring them, I thought. After 10 min of waiting finally managed to get through, but the line was so bad I was transferred to another call... 10 min... 15 min... no answer. I had to hang up and go back to work...I am selling my car and promised the guy I will put a new set of tyres on her... I know [REDACTED] doesn't care, but if they tell me they can get those fitted in two days and get good online reviews - well that's why I am buying from them and not elsewhere. I am kind of seriously stuck here because of them!***UPDATE***An email eventually came saying the tyres have been delivered and asking me if I had been aware of it and already had them fitted(???).... I replied saying noone let me know anything and I'm still awaiting for the appointment to be rescheduled. Guess what? No reply again. The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had). Explained what'd been going on and fortunately they kindly agreed to fit them for me. I'm not sure if this was just an isolated example of poor case handling by [REDACTED] or this is the way they treat their customers in general, should something go wrong.I normally don't have time for this sort of rubbish (unanswered emails, waiting in a phone queue for ages). You normally get a pretty decent customer service nowadays and its KEY to build good reputation for online retailers. Not good.*********************Hi TomI am really sorry for this issue.No, you are not. You don't care and only leave this comment here to make it look as if you care.

"Purchased on the behalf of a vehicle workshop. Order placed on Monday at 11.55am for 2 tyres at over £400, promised delivery of Tuesday next day. I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order.

I booked my tyre change for a complete set of tyres for an Aston Martin DB9. The appointed garage was excellent and the service was superb. My complaint is that the tyres I received were date stamped 2017 therefore were at least 2 years old. Upon complaining about this to [REDACTED] directly I was informed that these tyres are not pressed often and therefore up to date tyres could not be guaranteed. Unfortunately due to time commitments I was unable to reschedule my fitting and had to go ahead with the 2017 tyres. The car does not do a big mileage and therefore I have paid for tyres that are already at least two years short on their life cycle due to the natural degradation of the rubber compound.

The ordering process is very easy to use and convenient. It allows you to book a fitting at the nearest garage. I placed the order on Wednesday for a Friday fitting. On Thursday afternoon I received an email stating there was an issue delivering my tyre to the garage and that my fitting was being rebooked to Tuesday. I had to phone [REDACTED] as I had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on Friday. I am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that I would be without a vehicle for another 4 days!. [REDACTED] were unable to keep the Friday booking and I was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone. I kept the booking on Tuesday as the tyre which I ordered was only available through [REDACTED]. Come Tuesday there was no further problems the garage I chose was spot on. I awaited the compensation to be refunded back. Another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication. So I rang [REDACTED] who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo.This was sorted the following day and I did receive the amount promised.Overall I would say this was a rough ride ordering from [REDACTED].

The car failed because the tyre on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round!! Apparently the tyres are directional. Kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost. I chose Auto Pfect because [REDACTED] rated them as a premium fitter, and despite the staff being friendly and generally helpful, the mistakes made were very basic and avoidable for a professional tyre fitting garage.

Tyre wasn’t delivered in time for fitting. The next fitting appointment was then cancelled.

"Not very interested. I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice. Worse was the fact that [REDACTED] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue.Incidentally I did not bother with the discount as I was delighted with the service I received in Peebles.",wait time negative,garage service positive,"['interested', 'recently', 'tyre', 'fitted', 'tweeddale', 'motor', 'peebles', 'second', 'visit', 'redacted', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'friendly', 'efficient', 'pleasure', 'deal', 'reason', 'poor', 'rating', 'first', 'visit', 'tweeddale', 'motor', 'arranged', 'fitting', 'penicuik', 'went', 'get', 'tyre', 'fitted', 'told', 'redacted', 'customer', 'must', 'leave', 'car', 'four', 'hour', 'tyre', 'fitted', 'ready', 'collection', 'unable', 'said', 'would', 'return', 'another', 'day', 'looking', 'redacted', 'website', 'stated', 'queuing', 'process', 'would', 'operation', 'location', 'arrived', 'opening', 'time', 'couple', 'day', 'later', 'told', 'collect', 'car', 'four', 'hour', 'time', 'given', 'absence', 'customer', 'information', 'website', 'explained', 'unhappy', 'service', 'offered', 'told', 'wish', 'fit', 'procedure', 'would', 'return', 'tyre', 'agreed', 'would', 'probably', 'best', 'spoke', 'redacted', 'sympathetic', 'offering', 'discount', 'price', 'expressed', 'interest', 'including', 'fitting', 'procedure', 'penicuik', 'website', 'indeed', 'day', 'appears', 'unchanged', 'felt', 'like', 'second', 'class', 'customer', 'using', 'redacted', 'penicuik', 'condition', 'made', 'plain', 'website', 'would', 'able', 'make', 'different', 'choice', 'worse', 'fact', 'redacted', 'customer', 'relation', 'interested', 'addressing', 'think', 'real', 'issueincidentally', 'bother', 'discount', 'delighted', 'service', 'received', 'peebles']",{'garage service': 'positive'},positive

Let down so badly - I wish I did not have to give this review even 1 star as they are not worth it.They Emailed me at 17.17 last night saying they could not fit my tires the following day as already arranged. (They close at 17.30). I was traveling 5000 miles round trip the following day and my tires would become illegal during that time so urgently needed them done.They never responded to my email and I was on hold in a phone que for 35 minutes. Got put through to escaltion team who took another 10 minutes to answer.The only thing that was reasonable was the manner in which the complaint team approached the complaint however the best they could do is offer a refund plus £30 and a 10% discount on future purchases. The extra £30 did not even cover the additional costs that I incurred but at least they were polite and sypathetic and agreed to feed back that a phone call so late in the day would have been appropriate to give me some options..

Excellent price service. Recently bought 2 new tires from [REDACTED].com & was very pleased with the price which was much cheaper than I could find any where else. Gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes. Only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting. They said it will go out when I start driving but it did not. Stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure. Perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer. Not a big issue & easily resolved.

"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment.

Used many times before but never again. Ordered my tyres and selected my fitting date. Got an email to delay fitting date by 4 days because they claimed they couldn't get the tyres in that time. Arrived at selected garage on rearranged day and time and tyres hadn't arrived. Rang customer services and was told that the tyres were on the van and would be delivered later that day sometime. Fitting garage said they can get the tyres for the following day so I cancelled the [REDACTED] order and told the garage to order them in. They were paid for the tyres almost a week earlier but told me a refund would take 3-5 days. Told them this wasn't acceptable and the refund must be made that day. Tyres were fitted mid-day the following day and was told that the [REDACTED] tyres were delivered at the same time as the ones they ordered. I paid a 2% premium to get the tyres from a local garage but only pay when the job is finished.

"I have previously used [REDACTED] a few years ago with no problems so decided to use them again. Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage, so far so good.So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”, after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay. So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly). After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking, and the special price of £38 (I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear) so declined ......... call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people.So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok.Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up. 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi.Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F/N/S wheel has a nut missing, the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F/O/S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers.I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover. The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast. My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy!!Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again.

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way.

I went to my appointment 3 days later at 9am (my choice, they could have done it even sooner!) and they were waiting for me with my two new tyres!

"I found the staff at BC.com very polite and helpful and BC themselves were/are one of the cheapest online tyre suppliers. My gripe though concerns the fact that having ordered and paid online for 5 tyres for my Land-rover, when the day came for them to be fitted I had rung up the previous afternoon to be told they didn’t have the tyres so the fitting wouldn’t take place. As it was a home fitting I’d taken the day off!!!!I was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following Tuesday and the fifth by the Friday. Great thought I.Well, I got my four tyres fitted on the Tuesday. No problem.Thursday afternoon came at at about 5.30pm I got an email from BC stating they couldn’t get my 5th tyre and “how did I want to proceed”.Livid???? Just a tad.I called BC but by then they’d closed for the day, so rang first thing the next day. Very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre I’d ordered, paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn’t be obtained and BC didn’t know when they’d get some in.

"2x Bridgestone Potenza S001 285/30R19 Merc OnlyPROS:1) (easily) Best fitted price available anywhere2) Fitted at a local trader I know3) Customer Service was excellent in fixing a problem with the orderCONS:NONE!I bought 2 pretty expensive tyres for my Merc CLS. I’d had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40,000 miles on the rears. I’ve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced, I tried [REDACTED] (BC). Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres, I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size. Add to this there was a 10% off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader. The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know. Unfortunately when I got home, I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only(MO) tyre. The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims. I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem. The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is. BC went above and beyond:I contacted BC and they were fantastic. As I work in London, and I’m busy at the moment, it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC’s reference. However, despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting, BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one. Additionally, BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience.

"My first experience was great really straight forward fitter was really friendly, I did not hesitate to go back for my next purchase, unfortunately the fitter I had used before was busy so I chose another local one all seemed great.Then I get an email informing me my chosen fitter is unable to accomodate my tyre size, fine but if so they really should remove them as an option when you buy that size tyre.I was offered another fitter further away probably the only one available that day but I did not wish to drive too far with a tyre that could deflate at any time, I tried to decline the suggestion but this was ignored and the booking made, I did not have the time whilst working to be messed about I gave up and requested a refund.I had time off the following week so I decided to try once more to get the tyres sorted only to be misled by the search engine metadata and my own eagerness for a bargain, I was in too much of a hurry and thought I had finally found a real bargain, I did not check properly and I bought a smaller size 18 inch instead of 19 inch.I noticed as soon as I got the confirmation email and sent an email requesting the size change and to cancel the fitting date. obviously I would have to pay the difference.An email arrived confirming the fitting time so I sent another email requesting contact, 5 hours later I got another email (this is quick but seems like forever when you need something sorting)the email informed me I wanted to change the tyres I had already bought to the same ones really? why on earth would anyone want that? again they are not reading emails, I responded correcting the mistake.The following day I had heard nothing regarding the change and the appointment was due that day, I then received a text informing me my appointment was due in 30 minutes.I sent another email asking for urgent contact.Hours later still nothing.I then spent around ten minutes on hold only to be politely informed that someone would phone me back in a few hours.They did as promised phone me back and finally I got a person who listened, I explained my mistake she quickly sorted it explained the extra cost and booked the day and time for me.The fitter Mckinnon Motors was great again really quick and courteous.It is such a shame a hassle free way of getting a good deal on tyres is marred by poor communication skills.When it works it really works, when something goes wrong it can be a challenge.",call wait time negative,location negative,"['first', 'experience', 'great', 'really', 'straight', 'forward', 'fitter', 'really', 'friendly', 'hesitate', 'go', 'back', 'next', 'purchase', 'unfortunately', 'fitter', 'used', 'busy', 'chose', 'another', 'local', 'one', 'seemed', 'greatthen', 'get', 'email', 'informing', 'chosen', 'fitter', 'unable', 'accomodate', 'tyre', 'size', 'fine', 'really', 'remove', 'option', 'buy', 'size', 'tyrei', 'offered', 'another', 'fitter', 'away', 'probably', 'one', 'available', 'day', 'wish', 'drive', 'far', 'tyre', 'could', 'deflate', 'time', 'tried', 'decline', 'suggestion', 'ignored', 'booking', 'made', 'time', 'whilst', 'working', 'messed', 'gave', 'requested', 'refundi', 'time', 'following', 'week', 'decided', 'try', 'get', 'tyre', 'sorted', 'misled', 'search', 'engine', 'metadata', 'eagerness', 'bargain', 'much', 'hurry', 'thought', 'finally', 'found', 'real', 'bargain', 'check', 'properly', 'bought', 'smaller', 'size', '18', 'inch', 'instead', '19', 'inchi', 'noticed', 'soon', 'got', 'confirmation', 'email', 'sent', 'email', 'requesting', 'size', 'change', 'cancel', 'fitting', 'date', 'obviously', 'would', 'pay', 'differencean', 'email', 'arrived', 'confirming', 'fitting', 'time', 'sent', 'another', 'email', 'requesting', 'contact', '5', 'hour', 'later', 'got', 'another', 'email', 'quick', 'seems', 'like', 'forever', 'need', 'something', 'sortingthe', 'email', 'informed', 'wanted', 'change', 'tyre', 'already', 'bought', 'one', 'really', 'earth', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'reading', 'email', 'responded', 'correcting', 'mistakethe', 'following', 'day', 'heard', 'nothing', 'regarding', 'change', 'appointment', 'due', 'day', 'received', 'text', 'informing', 'appointment', 'due', '30', 'minutesi', 'sent', 'another', 'email', 'asking', 'urgent', 'contacthours', 'later', 'still', 'nothingi', 'spent', 'around', 'ten', 'minute', 'hold', 'politely', 'informed', 'someone', 'would', 'phone', 'back', 'hoursthey', 'promised', 'phone', 'back', 'finally', 'got', 'person', 'listened', 'explained', 'mistake', 'quickly', 'sorted', 'explained', 'extra', 'cost', 'booked', 'day', 'time', 'methe', 'fitter', 'mckinnon', 'motor', 'great', 'really', 'quick', 'courteousit', 'shame', 'hassle', 'free', 'way', 'getting', 'good', 'deal', 'tyre', 'marred', 'poor', 'communication', 'skillswhen', 'work', 'really', 'work', 'something', 'go', 'wrong', 'challenge']",{},positive

"This is not a review of [REDACTED].com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them (A&S MOT Ltd).A terrible experience meaning I will never use A&S MOT Ltd again. Details of the issues are below.- Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- Took time off work and waited at garage. Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.",value for money positive,garage service negative,"['review', 'redactedcom', 'experience', 'garage', 'booked', 'mot', 'ltda', 'terrible', 'experience', 'meaning', 'never', 'use', 'mot', 'ltd', 'detail', 'issue', 'arranged', 'paid', 'two', 'new', 'tyre', 'fitted', '4wheel', 'alignment', 'rear', 'tyre', 'wearing', 'inside', 'took', 'time', 'work', 'waited', 'garage', 'work', 'done', 'given', 'paperwork', 'wheel', 'dirty', 'expected', 'left', 'work', 'steering', 'wheel', 'offcentre', 'going', 'straight', 'got', 'work', 'checked', 'value', 'paperwork', 'rear', 'alignment', 'beforeafter', 'figure', 'unchanged', 'left', 'work', 'early', 'returned', 'garage', 'told', 'rear', 'adjustable', 'way', 'fit', 'new', 'part', 'arranged', 'bring', 'car', 'back', 'next', 'day', 'sort', 'steering', 'rang', 'audi', 'ask', 'part', 'required', 'etc', 'told', 'setting', 'adjustable', 'competent', 'garage', 'front', 'rear', 'went', 'another', 'wheel', 'alignment', 'place', 'asked', 'confirm', 'put', 'car', 'ramp', 'within', '30', 'second', 'said', 'didnt', 'even', 'need', 'specialist', 'tool', 'etc', 'took', 'time', 'work', 'return', 'agreed', 'told', 'finding', 'adjustment', 'said', 'would', 'sort', 'along', 'offcentre', 'steering', 'wheel', 'finished', 'told', 'done', 'given', 'paperwork', 'asked', 'printout', 'received', 'checked', 'whilst', 'rear', 'still', 'adjusted', 'asked', 'explanation', 'wasnt', 'given', 'one', 'told', 'would', 'need', 'bring', 'back', 'went', '100', 'mile', 'journey', 'someone', 'almost', 'drove', 'checked', 'dash', 'cam', 'found', 'moved', 'point', 'sky', 'reviewed', 'footage', 'employee', 'moved', 'prior', 'taking', 'car', 'drive', 'assume', 'wanted', 'drive', 'like', 'stole', 'cleaned', 'car', 'weekend', 'afterwards', 'gunk', 'wheel', 'actually', 'especially', 'one', 'also', 'stuck', 'like', 'glue', 'took', 'fairly', 'abrasive', 'wheel', 'cleaner', 'lot', 'effort', 'remove', 'checked', 'pressure', 'new', 'tyre', 'set', 'high', 'higher', 'maximum', 'load', 'pressure', 'indicated', 'car', 'itselfin', 'summary', 'dont', 'use', 'garage', 'value', 'vehicle', 'time', 'money', 'safety']","{'garage service': 'positive', 'wait time': 'positive'}",positive

"I’ve bought dozens of Michelin tyres from Costco (very professional tyre-fitting) but on this occasion I just wanted some mid-range tyres for 20yr old (but 80,000) Volvo V70 T5 that we keep sentimentally along with the other car that my dad owned when he died 5yrs ago. Chose Kumho’s as I’d bought a 2nd hand BMW with these on a few years ago and they seemed OK. Existing Avon (ZV-7’s(?)) only 20% worn / 2 years old, but showing extensive micro-cracking to sidewalls. (Incidentally: Seen this before on Avon’s put on the kids’ cars, so consequently wouldn’t touch these again).Responded to customer satisfaction email from [REDACTED] commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over-torqued wheelnuts (140Nm vs. 110Nn), suggesting they might want to look at their QC/spec. on this. By the time I got a response, requesting a copy of the jobsheet, it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure, so advised this additionally, when sending copy jobsheet Invited to return to fitting depot to rectify. Unfortunately, return visit was an absolute object lesson in how NOT to deal with a customer service issue, particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided, not least because it impacts directly on their safety.So:- (Manager) Don’t moan to me as soon as I arrive that you’ve “been dealing with nothing but problems all day!”. I don’t care. I just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place.- (Fitter) Crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground, not against the auto gearbox-“Park”. This is car DIY, page 1. Unbelievable!- (Manager) Don’t tell me that “often old cars leak from the rims”, inferring there’s nothing to be done in that case. I drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel, and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal. Any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim, note this, and, as necessary, wire brush or even file this smooth.- (Manager) When faced with my sceptical look about “leaky rims”, don’t then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing, or a pothole as the culprit (what, in the 20 miles since fitting?!) The rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that’s all there is to it. - (Fitter) Tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern, not a circle. And do the same with each of the nuts. Just because there are 5, you don’t have to forget to torque down the 5th! I watched you! - (Fitter) Having been told the other wheel remains over-torqued to 140Nm where’s the spec is 110, don’t check it with your torque wrench set at 110Nm and then tell me it’s OK - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly, to the correct torque! God Almighty!They’ve had their chance, and another, so suffice it to say I will not be darkening their doorstep again. It’s a shame, because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable, mid-range, not ultra-premium, in a tyre. It would never happen, because their prices for the latter,e.g. Michelin, are higher than Costco, but theoretically I could have been going to [REDACTED] and spending £1200+ on 4 tyres for one of my other cars, not £150 on 2...

Purchased 4 tyres to be fitted (at Lavender Motors in Haywards Heath). Car returned, one tyre with dangerously low air pressure. Asked the garage to top up the tyre and check the other three. They did top up the one tyre but didn't bother to check the others. When I checked the tyres 10 minutes later all four tyres had varying pressures (from 29 to 37.5). I emailed both companies and have not received an apology from either. I will never use Lavender Motors again (they shouldn't be in business) and likely not [REDACTED].com either.,garage service negative,"['purchased', '4', 'tyre', 'fitted', 'lavender', 'motor', 'haywards', 'heath', 'car', 'returned']",{},neutral
